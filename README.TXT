OIPA: OpenAid IATI parser and API Version 
============

Technology developed within the openaid.nl platform enables IATI standard compliant datasets to 
easily parse and interface that data using the OIPA framework that has been developed. 

So what is IATI? IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier 
to access, use and understand using a unified open standard. You can find more about the IATI standard at:
