OIPA
============

Technology developed within the www.openaid.nl platform enables IATI standard compliant datasets to 
easily parse and interface that data using the OIPA framework that has been developed. It is implemented for UN-Habitat
at http://open.unhabitat.org 

So what is IATI? IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier 
to access, use and understand using a unified open standard. You can find more about the IATI standard at:

OIPA has an open-source license (AGPL), meaning you can download and hanhdle the code from Github.
