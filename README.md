OIPA V2.1: OpenAid IATI parser and API 
============

OIPA Version 2.1 is developed within the www.openaid.nl platform and enables IATI standard compliant datasets to easily parse and 
interface that data using the OIPA framework that has been developed. 

IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier to access, 
re-use and understand the underlying data using a unified open standard. You can find more about IATA standard at:
