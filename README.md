OIPA: OpenAid IATI parser and API 
============

OIPA is developed within the www.openaid.nl and www.openaidsearch.org platform and enables IATI standard compliant datasets to easily parse and  interface that data using the OIPA framework that has been developed using a Django interface.

IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier to access, 
re-use and understand the underlying data using a unified open standard. You can find more about IATA standard at:
